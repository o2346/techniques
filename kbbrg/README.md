## description

Home maded [keyboard brigde](https://www.google.com/search?q=keyboard+bridge&tbm=isch) to support [sonshi-style](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E5%B0%8A%E5%B8%AB%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB&tbm=isch)  
not only for keyboard but any other pointing devices

## what is this for

I use macbook pro with hhkb & trackball in my work.  
When a external keyboard was settled directly on a laptop computer(this is what they say sonshi-style), Some inconvenience found like

* unintentionally hit any key of laptop
  * you may disable laptop keyboard, but it is not very butiful since some installation & configuration required
  * I think this is not a software matter
* I need external trackball on the same height with hhkb
  * I don't see any products wide enough to support trackball + hhkb width
* computer and the device on it gets hot

then this thing is a solution

## disadvantage

* less portability
 * though I don't need to take them outside so often
 * I have got macbook for that poupouse

## misc

A [palm rest](https://www.google.com/search?q=palm+rest&tbm=isch) should be dedicated with it

## usage

just use like img shown above

## recipe

1. buy a wooden board
  * A board should be as flat as possible
1. build like img shown above
  * Some DIY shop takes order to cut board as you like, ask them if needed
  * then you may not need a saw, all you would need is nail & hammer
